A **dynamic programming language**Â is a programming language in which some operations are performed during execution that would be performed during compilation in a static  programming language.

For example, a static programming language would only allow plugins to be added during compilation, while a dynamic programming language _might_ allow plugins to be loaded at runtime.

Generally you can tell them apart because a static language is fully defined at compile time: all variables are known and its behavior can be fully understood using static analysis.
By contrast the variables and behaviour of a dynamic language depends on the environment at runtime.

> **Note:** [Dynamic typing](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Dynamic_typing)/[static-typing](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Static_typing) are not synonymous with dynamic/static programming languages.
> C++ and JavaScript, for example, dynamic programming language that uses static and dynamic typing, respectively.

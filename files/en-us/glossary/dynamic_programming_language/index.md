A **dynamic programming language** is a programming language in which operations otherwise done at compile-time can be done at run-time.
For example, in JavaScript it is possible to change the type of a variable or add new properties or methods to an object while the program is running.

This is opposed to so-called static programming languages, in which such changes are normally not possible.

> **Note:** [Dynamic typing](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Dynamic_typing)/[static-typing](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Static_typing) are not synonymous with dynamic/static programming languages.
> For example, C++ and JavaScript are both dynamic programming languages, but C++ is statically typed, while Javascript is dynamically typed.
